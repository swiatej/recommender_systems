# recommender_systems
A recommender system based on the last.fm dataset

This project entailed creating three recommender systems: using user similarities, using clustering, and using softmax neural networks. I first go through data cleaning and data exploration (mostly using various bar plots and histograms), and then train various recommender systems.
